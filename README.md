Uses the dVRK (https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros) and ros_ovr_sdk (https://github.com/OSUrobotics/ros_ovr_sdk) ROS packages to allow the manipulators of the da Vinci(R) Surgical System to be controlled by an Oculus Rift headset. Ultimate goal is to allow the surgeon to control the endoscope with the movement of their head and view the feed through the display.

Linked below is a paper describing the installation of the ROS packages along with their dependencies, the calibration process, and the use of the oculus_dvrk package.
