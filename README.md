Uses the dVRK (https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros) and ros_ovr_sdk (https://github.com/OSUrobotics/ros_ovr_sdk) ROS packages
to allow the manipulators of the da Vinci(R) Surgical System to be controlled by an Oculus Rift headset. Ultimate goal is to allow
the surgeon to control the endoscope with the movement of their head and view the feed through the display.
